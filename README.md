# JavaStudy

Initially, it was a private repo to prepare for the Java SE 8 Programmer (OCA/OCP), but I decided to make it private, so if you're studying Java and prepare for the exam, you can have a look and compare it with your code. 

You will find some of the Java core concepts:
- concurrency
- enums
- exceptions
- inner classes
- interfaces
- lambdas, streams
- singletons
- comparators
- constructors
- generics
- polymorphism
- inheritance
- dates
- static cases
- RxJava
- overriding, overloading
